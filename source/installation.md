Apollo iOS requires Xcode 8, which you can install from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

Follow these steps to use Apollo iOS in your app:

1. Install the Apollo framework into your project and link it to your application target
1. Install `apollo-codegen` globally through npm
1. Add a code generation build step to your target
1. Add the generated API file to your target
1. Install the Xcode add-ons to get syntax highlighting for your `.graphql` files (optional)

<h2 id="installing-framework">Installing the Apollo framework</h2>

You can install `Apollo.framework` into your project using Carthage, CocoaPods, or by manually integrating it with Xcode.

### Carthage

1. Add `github "apollostack/apollo-ios"` to your Cartfile.

1. Run `carthage update`.

1. Drag and drop `Apollo.framework` from the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder to the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section of your application targets’ “General” settings tab.

1. On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

 ```sh
 /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
 ```

 and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

 ```
 $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Apollo.framework
 ```
 This script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries and ensures that necessary bitcode-related files and dSYMs are copied when archiving.

### CocoaPods

 1. Because Apollo iOS has been written using Swift 3, it requires CocoaPods 1.1.0, which is still in prerelease at the moment (currently at `rc.3`). You can install it using:

 ```sh
 gem install cocoapods --pre
 ```

 1. Add `pod "Apollo"` to your Podfile.

 1. Run `pod install`.

 1. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project.

### Manual integration

You can also manually clone the [`apollo-ios` repository](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-ios), drag `Apollo.xcodeproj` into your project or workspace, add a dependency on `Apollo.framework` to your target.

<h2 id="installing-apollo-codegen">Installing `apollo-codegen`</h2>

You will have to install the `apollo-codegen` command globally through npm:

```sh
npm install -g apollo-codegen
```

<h2 id="adding-build-step">Adding a code generation build step</h2>

In order to invoke `apollo-codegen` as part of the Xcode build process, create a build step that runs before “Compile Sources”.

1. On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script, change its name to “Generate Apollo GraphQL API” and drag it just above “Compile Sources”. Then add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

```sh
APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH=$(eval find $FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS -name "Apollo.framework" -maxdepth 1)

if [ -z "$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH" ]; then
  echo "error: Couldn't find Apollo.framework in FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS; make sure to add the framework to your project."
  exit 1
fi

cd ${SRCROOT}/${TARGET_NAME}
$APOLLO_FRAMEWORK_PATH/check-and-run-apollo-codegen.sh generate $(find . -name '*.graphql') --schema schema.json --output API.swift
```

The script above will invoke `apollo-codegen` through the `check-and-run-apollo-codegen.sh` wrapper script, which is actually contained in the `Apollo.framework` bundle. The main reason for this is to check whether the version of `apollo-codegen` installed on your system is compatible with the framework version installed in your project, and to warn you if it isn't. Without this check, you could end up generating code that is incompatible with the runtime code contained in the framework.

<h2 id="adding-generated-api">Adding the generated API file to your target</h2>

1. Drag the generated `API.swift` file to your target.

<h2 id="installing-xcode-add-ons">Installing the Xcode add-ons to get syntax highlighting</h2>

1. Clone the [`xcode-apollo` repository](https://github.com/apollostack/xcode-apollo) to your computer.
1. Close Xcode if it is currently running.
1. Copy `GraphQL.ideplugin` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins`.
1. Copy `GraphQL.xclangspec` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Specifications`.

You may receive a warning when you first start up Xcode after installing these add-ons.
